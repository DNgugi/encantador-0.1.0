The website will support three languages to serve Hong Kong's diverse market:

- **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**: For local Hong Kong and Taiwan markets
- **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**: For mainland China business connections

### Implementation Approach

#### URL Structure

```
/en/ (English - default)
/zh-hk/ (Traditional Chinese)
/zh-cn/ (Simplified Chinese)
```

#### Language Detection & Selection

- Automatic browser language detection on first visit
- Prominent language selector in header
- Language preference stored in localStorage
- Fallback to English for unsupported languages

#### Content Management

- **Static Content**: Manually translated and curated for accuracy
- **Dynamic Content**: Google Translate API with human review
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Beyond translation - cultural context consideration
- **SEO Optimization**: Hreflang tags for proper search engine indexing

#### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Language switching functionality
const languageConfig = {
  en: { name: "English", flag: "🇺🇸", dir: "ltr" },
  "zh-hk": { name: "繁體中文", flag: "🇭🇰", dir: "ltr" },
  "zh-cn": { name: "简体中文", flag: "🇨🇳", dir: "ltr" },
};
```

### Content Translation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Homepage, Services, About, Contact
2. **Medium Priority**: Portfolio descriptions, Process details
3. **Low Priority**: Blog posts, detailed case studies

### Cultural Considerations

- **Color Schemes**: Ensure colors are culturally appropriate (avoid unlucky colors)
- **Number Formatting**: Local number and date formats
- **Business Etiquette**: Formal tone in Chinese versions
- **Contact Methods**: WeChat integration for Chinese-speaking clients
